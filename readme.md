# SDD_Proj

## The plan:

Create three C files, the main file, which handles the arguments and calls the functions, one as a 'kernel' of sorts and one more for all the custom functionality.

LUT of function names -> pointers of the functions for calling by the audio processer. Opening of files required too.

http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/ <- The WAV format.
