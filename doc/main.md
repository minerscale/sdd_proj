# Defining and Understanding the Problem

## The Problem

I wanna put a bunch of cool effects on my music. Specifically, I want to be able to create my own effects which achieve things not yet created by software which already exists. I need something that reads a .wav file and outputs a modified .wav file. I want it to be fast and I want a reasonable number of effects (at least 5). I won't go as far as to make an autotune effect because things like that are very difficult and require a very fundamental understanding of audio processing.

This project should not be too hard to implement. I would imagine it's not too many hours of work and once I get the framework for each audio processing algorithm going, the rest of the project will be a breeze. It costs nothing and my time costs nothing as it it a school project. The user would only need a copy of Windows or Linux and a computer capable of processing the audio faster than the heat death of the universe. I could bundle a python runtime to make running the program even easier. 

I think I'm going to use an open source licence. I don't see the reason of using anything else. I think it's the best option so I can give back to the people who so graciously give their time. Apart from the actual licence on the software and it's dependencies, I doubt there are any legal ramifications of digitally manipulating audio except for maybe if the audio you are trying to manipulate has some licence on it that prevents you from editing it, though I'm pretty sure it would really only prevent you from releasing it to the public, which is beyond the scope of what this piece of software can do.



## Design Specifications

**Developer's Perspective:** I'm going to use the RAD development approach as I feel it is the least intrusive to my process giving just enough structure to my work without utterly consuming me with documentation. RAD simply means doing some requirements planning, which involves determining what environment (languages, frameworks etc.) I will be using so I can begin to develop the software itself as soon as possible. I do not think it is necessary to use something more rigorous like the structured approach because I am a one man team; I do not have to consider other people when writing my software. Four weeks is not enough time to completely forget what I'm up to. In terms of data types, I'm going to use integers, floats, like, all of them. And for data structures, I'm going to use lists, and *strings?* (Are strings a data structure or a data type?).

**User's Perspective:** I wish to have a GUI to make the user more comfortable using my program, I also don't want to restrict the user from using the command line tool if they so please (it is faster and more automatable). I need the language to be formal and dry as if a tech startup wrote it. No style, no grace, this Kong has a funny face. I need it to accept a readily
